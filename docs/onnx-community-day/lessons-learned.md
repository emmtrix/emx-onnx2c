# Lessons learned

This file expands the technical lessons that should inform the presentation.

## 1. Existing ONNX-to-C tooling proved the need, but not the final approach

The project history starts with `onnx2c`.

What worked:

- It demonstrated that compiling ONNX graphs to C is useful.
- It gave a concrete reference point for what generated C could look like.
- It helped identify practical requirements for embedded deployments.

What did not work well enough:

- Generated-code quality was difficult for the desired use case.
- There was not enough control over the generated code structure.
- Dynamic-dimension support was a major pain point.

Implication:

For embedded systems, generated code is not just an implementation detail. It is
an artifact that may need review, analysis, certification, debugging, and further
source-to-source optimization.

## 2. Dynamic dimensions need a C representation, but representation is not semantics

The VLA-parameter idea was one motivation for starting a new implementation.

Example:

```c
void model(int N, int C,
           const float x[restrict N][C],
           float y[restrict N][C]);
```

Why this is useful:

- C can express runtime tensor extents in the function signature.
- The generated ABI stays explicit.
- The rank remains statically known.
- Loop bounds can use explicit extent parameters.
- N-dimensional C array types carry more semantic information than flat 1D
  buffers.

Why N-dimensional arrays matter:

- Both N-dimensional arrays and flat 1D arrays can address the same contiguous
  tensor memory.
- But in C, the declared array type matters.
- Accessing beyond the bounds of a declared array object is undefined behavior,
  even if the next logical tensor row is contiguous in memory.
- With `float x[N][C]`, the rank and inner extent are visible in the type.
- With `float *x`, the tensor structure exists only as an offset-calculation
  convention.
- Keeping tensor structure in the type improves readability, reviewability, and
  downstream analysis.

Flat generated code:

```c
void add_flat(int N, int C,
              const float *restrict a,
              const float *restrict b,
              float *restrict out) {
    for (int n = 0; n < N; ++n) {
        for (int c = 0; c < C; ++c) {
            int idx = n * C + c;
            out[idx] = a[idx] + b[idx];
        }
    }
}
```

N-dimensional VLA generated code:

```c
void add_vla(int N, int C,
             const float a[restrict N][C],
             const float b[restrict N][C],
             float out[restrict N][C]) {
    for (int n = 0; n < N; ++n) {
        for (int c = 0; c < C; ++c) {
            out[n][c] = a[n][c] + b[n][c];
        }
    }
}
```

Limits:

- The target compiler must support VLAs.
- Memory may still be unbounded unless extents are constrained.
- It does not solve dynamic rank.
- It does not solve unbounded sequence length.
- It does not solve unbounded string size.

Takeaway:

VLAs are a useful lowering strategy for some dynamic shapes, but an AOT compiler
still needs explicit bounds and constraints.

## 3. Broad coverage changes the compiler architecture

After initial success, the project goal expanded to broad ONNX support.

This changed the system:

- The compiler needed a pass-based architecture.
- Import, normalization, lowering, and code generation needed clearer boundaries.
- Unsupported cases needed explicit, testable diagnostics.
- Coverage reports became part of the development workflow.
- Golden/reference updates became necessary for deterministic code generation.

Design consequence:

A high-coverage ONNX compiler cannot be a set of ad hoc special cases. It needs
registries, structured lowering, stable IR objects, and a verification strategy.

## 4. 100% test coverage is an architectural constraint

The project goal of 100% test coverage across the compiler pipeline influenced
implementation details.

It encouraged:

- small functions and classes
- clear pass contracts
- explicit context objects instead of global state
- deterministic output for stable golden tests
- predictable error handling
- separable verification logic

It discouraged:

- hidden global state
- oversized "god" modules
- implicit shape assumptions
- broad mutation during passes
- codegen behavior that depends on verification-only inputs

Talk framing:

The important point is not only "we wanted high coverage". The point is that the
coverage target forced better compiler architecture.

## 4a. ORT-derived artifacts made coverage more realistic

The test strategy did not stop at local unit tests or the official ONNX backend
tests. `emx-ort-test-artifacts` provides an additional corpus by exporting ONNX
Runtime tests into an ONNX-backend-test-like format: a model directory with
`model.onnx` plus protobuf input/output test data.

The principle is:

```text
ORT test case -> exported ONNX model + test_data_set_* -> backend-runnable test artifact
```

That makes ORT test cases usable outside the ORT C++ test harness.

The artifact should also carry the comparison contract. ORT tests can have
per-output validation expectations, including relative and absolute error
thresholds. In the current artifact repository, these are stored in
`validation.json` files with fields such as:

- `relative_error`
- `absolute_error`
- `sort_output`
- `expects_failure`
- `expected_failure_substring`

For ONNX-backend-test compatibility, these constraints should be translated to
the ONNX backend `data.json` format. That would make the generated artifacts
look more like native ONNX backend tests: model, protobuf test data, and
comparison tolerances in the expected place.

Why this matters:

- Official ONNX backend tests are an essential standards-facing baseline.
- ORT-derived artifacts apply a similar model-plus-test-data pattern to a
  broader runtime-oriented test corpus.
- They include model directories, test data sets, contrib/operator scenarios,
  and edge cases that are closer to how a production runtime validates itself.
- They force the compiler and verification pipeline to handle real model/test
  directory structure, not only hand-written micrographs.
- They can preserve ORT's intended numerical tolerances instead of forcing all
  backends into one global comparison policy.
- They make unsupported cases reproducible through recorded command lines.

Project use:

- The corpus is available as the `emx-ort-test-artifacts-org/` submodule.
- Test data lives under `emx-ort-test-artifacts-org/artifacts/onnxruntime`.
- The generated `ONNX_SUPPORT.md` report tracks this corpus separately from
  official ONNX backend coverage.
- Expected-error JSON files record exact `verify` commands for individual
  failing or unsupported artifacts.

Talk framing:

- Do not make exact coverage percentages the central claim.
- The important point is the engineering loop: broad corpus, deterministic
  verification, reproducible failures, and visible progress.
- `emx-ort-test-artifacts` helped turn "operator support" into a more realistic
  backend validation story.
- This could also be useful beyond `emx-onnx-cgen`: other ONNX backends could
  use ORT-exported, ONNX-backend-test-like artifacts to compare against a
  broader ORT-derived behavior corpus.
- The idea was mentioned in ORT-related forums, but the response was minimal.
  Present this neutrally as an underused community opportunity, not as a
  complaint.

## 5. ONNX is excellent interchange, but not naturally bounded AOT compiler IR

ONNX allows flexibility that is valuable for interchange and runtime execution.
For deterministic AOT compilation, that flexibility becomes a problem unless it
is constrained.

Problem areas:

- unknown tensor dimensions
- symbolic dimensions without concrete maxima
- dynamic output sizes
- unbounded sequence length
- unbounded string length
- container values that do not map cleanly to a static C ABI

Compiler response:

- require static shapes where necessary
- support VLAs where the shape is representable and acceptable
- require explicit sequence element shape declarations for ragged inputs
- use fixed-size string storage
- fail clearly when required information is missing

Community implication:

An AOT-friendly ONNX profile could be useful. It might specify what model
properties must be bounded or statically known for deterministic code generation.

Dynamic-dimension-specific issue:

- ONNX can mark dimensions as symbolic or unknown.
- That gives the compiler a runtime extent, but not a maximum extent.
- VLA parameters can represent known-rank tensors with runtime dimensions in the
  C ABI.
- VLAs do not solve memory planning by themselves: temporaries and caller buffers
  may still grow without a compile-time bound.
- A backend without dynamic memory must either require maxima, require
  caller-provided storage with capacities, accept unbounded stack usage, or
  reject the model.

Sequence-specific issue:

- ONNX sequences are container values, not just tensors with one more axis.
- A runtime can represent a sequence as a growable object or a list of tensor
  objects.
- This is the same basic problem as ONNX strings: the logical value has a
  variable, unbounded length, but static C storage needs an explicit maximum.
- For strings, the missing bound is maximum characters per string element.
- For sequences, the missing bound is maximum number of sequence elements.
- A static C ABI needs a bounded representation: maximum sequence length,
  element dtype, element rank, element shape, and sometimes per-item dynamic
  dimensions.
- Without a maximum length, the compiler cannot reserve fixed storage.
- Without element-shape information, the compiler cannot choose the C array
  type for the sequence payload.
- Ragged sequences are especially awkward: the data buffer needs max-sized
  storage, and the real per-item dimensions need separate metadata.
- Nested containers, optionals, or mixed practical representations make the
  analysis even less natural for generated C.

`emx-onnx-cgen` policy:

- support `sequence(tensor(...))` at the model IO ABI as fixed-capacity tensor
  arrays plus count metadata
- represent inputs as
  `const T name[EMX_SEQUENCE_MAX_LEN][elem_shape...]` plus `idx_t name__count`
- represent outputs as
  `T name[EMX_SEQUENCE_MAX_LEN][elem_shape...]` plus `idx_t *name__count`
- emit `#define EMX_SEQUENCE_MAX_LEN 32` by default, guarded with `#ifndef`
- allow users/toolchains to override the macro at compile time
- require explicit `--sequence-element-shape` hints for sequence inputs with
  unknown or dynamic element dimensions
- for ragged sequence inputs, allocate max-sized element storage and pass
  per-item dimension arrays such as `name__dim_<axis>[EMX_SEQUENCE_MAX_LEN]`
- keep only the first `name__count` entries meaningful

Talk framing:

- A sequence length is like a dynamic dimension, but one level higher.
- It is also directly analogous to string length: both are unbounded lengths in
  the ONNX value model that must become bounded storage in C.
- A tensor dimension asks: "how large is this axis?"
- A sequence asks: "how many tensor objects exist, and what is each tensor's
  shape?"
- That object-level variability is comfortable for runtimes, but not for static
  C without an explicit capacity contract.

String-specific issue:

- ONNX string tensors do not declare a maximum string length.
- A backend with dynamic allocation can represent variable-length strings at
  runtime.
- A backend without dynamic memory must reserve storage at compile time, for
  example `char x[...][EMX_STRING_MAX_LEN]`.
- Without a maximum, the compiler must either require a user-provided bound,
  pick a global policy, risk truncation/wasted memory, or reject the model.

`emx-onnx-cgen` policy:

- represent each string element as a fixed-size, null-terminated C char array
  `char[EMX_STRING_MAX_LEN]`
- emit `#define EMX_STRING_MAX_LEN 256` by default, guarded with `#ifndef`
- allow users/toolchains to override the macro at compile time
- keep memory layout static and deterministic
- accept the trade-off that arbitrary ONNX string length is not represented
  without an explicit bound
- in testbench serialization, truncate strings that exceed the fixed slot size
  so that the result remains null-terminated

### Proposal: extend the ONNX type system with size bounds

Important framing: this is **not** an emx-specific feature or annotation — it is
a general extension of the ONNX type system that any backend would benefit from.

The gap is general: ONNX value types carry no maximum size for strings,
sequences, or dynamic dimensions, so every static/AOT backend has to invent one,
and different backends can disagree for the same model. emx's particular
workaround — a single global macro (`EMX_SEQUENCE_MAX_LEN`,
`EMX_STRING_MAX_LEN`) that wastes memory or truncates — is just one symptom.

The proposal is to make a maximum size an optional, standard part of the ONNX
type:

- a per-type default maximum (e.g. default max sequence length, max string
  length);
- a per-tensor override, so a specific input/output declares its own maximum;
- carried in type info / `value_info`, backwards-compatible (tools that ignore
  it still work).

Because it lives in the type system, every exporter, runtime, compiler and tool
reads the same bound — the same model yields the same sizing everywhere, with no
waste and no silent truncation. This is the standardized, persisted-in-the-type
counterpart of the `--sequence-element-shape` command-line specification.
Conceptually (type-level sketch, not emx metadata): `tensor(string)[max_len=64]`,
`sequence(tensor(float)[<=100, 4])[max_len=20]` — the element bound carries the
tensor rank and a maximum per dimension, positionally (axis 0 <= 100, axis 1 = 4),
not just a single number, plus `max_len` for the number of items.

## 6. ONNX type and shape inference cannot be the only analysis layer

Practical issue:

ONNX type and shape inference is incomplete for some operators or insufficient
for generated C decisions.

Examples of analysis difficulty:

- output rank or dimensions may depend on input values
- container element shapes may be missing
- subgraph operators may require pattern recognition
- dynamic-output operators may need capacity decisions

Compiler response:

- normalize attributes and types during import
- add compiler-side validation/inference where needed
- make missing information an explicit error
- avoid using verification data to fill codegen gaps implicitly

Community-facing gap:

- There is no broadly reliable, standalone library that computes shapes and
  types for ONNX models with dynamic dimensions well enough for static compiler
  use cases.
- Every serious backend or compiler is tempted to reimplement parts of this
  logic: ONNX importers, MLIR frontends, code generators, verifiers, and
  optimization tools.
- This duplicates effort and can produce different answers for the same model.
- A useful community artifact would be a shared and extensible shape/type
  inference library that understands symbolic and dynamic dimensions, preserves
  constraints, and reports unresolved information explicitly.
- Extensibility matters: the library should support registered inference rules
  for external operator domains, for example Microsoft/ORT contrib operators,
  not only the ONNX core operator set.
- Ideally, the inferred results and constraints could be written back into the
  ONNX model, for example as enriched `value_info` / metadata / annotations.
- Then code generators would not need to own the inference algorithm. They
  could consume a model with persisted analysis results.

Vision:

- We are exploring a DSL for specifying shape/type inference rules.
- The rule should be written once and be usable from both C++ and Python.
- The same rule should support numeric shape evaluation for concrete dimensions
  and symbolic shape evaluation for symbolic dimensions, for example via SymPy.
- A DSL makes custom operators more tractable: a custom operator could ship its
  own shape/type rule rather than requiring every backend to hard-code it.
- In the long term, such DSL rules could even be stored inside ONNX models as
  metadata for custom operators.
- This should be presented as a vision and research direction, not as a
  finished capability.

Talk framing:

- Shape/type inference should be separable from code generation.
- Shape/type inference should also be separable from a fixed operator universe;
  external domains need a plugin or registry mechanism.
- Persisting inference results in ONNX would make the analysis reusable across
  backends, MLIR import paths, validators, and source-to-source compilers.
- This is similar to the `emx-ort-test-artifacts` idea: make useful compiler
  knowledge portable as model artifacts rather than trapping it inside one
  backend implementation.

## 7. ONNX dtype mapping is uneven in C

Straightforward cases:

- standard integer tensors map to fixed-width C integer types
- `float` and `double` map naturally to C floating types
- `bool` maps naturally to C boolean storage

Less straightforward cases:

- `float16` can use `_Float16` where the C compiler and target support it
- `bfloat16` typically relies on compiler/target extensions such as `__bf16`
- 2-bit and 4-bit integer types can use C23 `_BitInt(N)`
- `_BitInt(N)` gives a type-level value range, but arrays may still waste memory
  compared with manually packed sub-byte storage
- FP8/FP4 types are not standard C arithmetic types
- `emx-onnx-cgen` represents FP8/FP4 values as small integer storage, usually
  `uint8_t`, plus explicit conversion helpers

Talk framing:

- common numeric types are boring in a good way
- reduced-precision and sub-byte types expose the gap between ONNX's type system
  and portable C
- FP8 support is currently more useful for type coverage and completeness than
  for efficient portable C execution

## 8. Numerical accuracy requirements need clearer contracts

When validating generated C against reference implementations, numerical
differences are not always straightforward.

Sources of ambiguity:

- accumulation precision
- rounding behavior
- math-library differences
- approximations
- implementation-defined edge cases
- differences between ONNX Runtime and ONNX Reference behavior
- official tests that do not define a complete tolerance policy

Current project response:

- compare floating outputs using ULP-based thresholds after an absolute epsilon
  check
- require exact matches for non-floating outputs
- expose compatibility switches where known runtime behavior needs to be
  replicated for debugging

Community implication:

Backend authors would benefit from clearer numerical accuracy expectations in
operator specifications and official tests.

Observed tolerance models:

- ONNX backend tests default to `rtol=1e-3` and `atol=1e-7`, with optional
  per-test `data.json` overrides.
- In the checked ONNX tree, `data.json` is used for `real` model tests, not for
  individual `node` operator tests.
- Therefore ONNX backend tests do not currently provide operator-specific
  tolerances through `data.json`.
- ONNX backend tests use a NumPy-style absolute-plus-relative check:
  `abs(actual - expected) <= atol + rtol * abs(expected)`.
- ONNX Runtime model tests use per-sample absolute and relative tolerances and
  can override them via test-case `config.txt`.
- PyTorch's `torch.testing.assert_close` uses dtype-dependent default
  tolerances, for example different defaults for `float16`, `bfloat16`,
  `float32`, and `float64`.
- TensorFlow testing also has dtype-aware close checks, such as
  `assertAllCloseAccordingToType`.
- JAX follows NumPy-style `allclose` defaults (`rtol=1e-5`, `atol=1e-8`) and
  the same absolute-plus-relative formula.
- MXNet's `assert_almost_equal` combines relative and absolute thresholds, but
  considers arrays equal if either check passes.
- NVIDIA Polygraphy exposes `--rtol` and `--atol` as comparator options and
  supports per-output tolerances; its docs explicitly warn that FP32-oriented
  defaults may be too strict for lower precision such as FP16 or INT8.

`emx-onnx-cgen` verification takes a different approach:

- ignore tiny absolute differences up to `atol_eps * eps(dtype)`
- compute ULP distance for remaining floating differences
- report the maximum ULP distance
- compare non-floating outputs exactly

Why this matters:

- A single fixed `rtol`/`atol` pair is not equally meaningful for all floating
  dtypes.
- `float16`, `float32`, and `float64` have very different spacing between
  representable values.
- ULP-based measurement is closer to the question "how many representable
  floating-point values apart are these results?"

Practical consequence in this project:

- Some ONNX reference outputs appear to be computed with very high precision.
- Combined with strict ULP-based verification, this required 64-bit accumulation
  for selected official tests.
- The compiler exposes this as `--fp32-accumulation-strategy fp64`.
- Several expectation files for official ONNX tests use that option.

## 8. Generated-code quality is a backend feature

For embedded and resource-constrained systems, generated C has different
requirements than a hidden runtime implementation.

Desired generated-code properties:

- readable
- deterministic
- auditable
- stable across runs
- explicit memory layout
- no dynamic allocation
- minimal runtime dependencies
- simple public API

This was one reason to move beyond `onnx2c` for this project.

External validation:

- The public ONNX Backend Scoreboard lists `emx-onnx-cgen` directly after
  `ONNX Reference` in the stable-build table.
- The scoreboard is based on ONNX backend unit tests, so it is a useful
  compatibility signal.
- It does not capture all AOT-compiler concerns: deterministic generated C,
  static memory planning, readable source, auditability, or safety-oriented
  build integration.
- Talk framing: use the scoreboard placement as credibility, then pivot to the
  deeper lesson that "can execute the unit tests" is only one dimension of
  backend quality.

## 9. C is the handoff IR in the emmtrix embedded AI flow

`emx-onnx-cgen` should be presented as more than a standalone ONNX-to-C
translator. In the emmtrix toolchain, it acts as an AI frontend compiler:

```text
ONNX model -> emx-onnx-cgen -> clean C -> emmtrix Vectorizer / backend tools
```

The generated C is deliberately used as an intermediate representation for
later source-to-source analysis and optimization. Internally, this means the
project is not merely "printing C"; it is producing a disciplined subset of C
plus conventions:

- explicit loop nests
- explicit tensor dimensions and strides
- predictable memory accesses
- stable symbol names and deterministic ordering
- no hidden dynamic dispatch
- no heap allocation
- minimal runtime assumptions

This is close in spirit to MLIR-style compilation: lower a high-level model into
a representation that later compiler passes can analyze and transform. The
important difference is the exposed handoff artifact. MLIR/LLVM-centered flows
often keep the key IR inside the compiler stack and then lower toward LLVM or a
runtime. The emmtrix flow intentionally exposes C source code as the handoff
format.

Why this matters:

- C is standardized and broadly understood.
- The result can be reviewed by engineers and static analysis tools.
- Existing embedded build systems can compile it.
- Heterogeneous C/C++ compilers can be used, including compilers from
  safety-critical environments.
- The generated artifact fits workflows where traceability, qualification, and
  source-level audits matter.

This also reframes generated-code quality:

- Poor generated C is not only ugly output.
- It weakens downstream analysis, vectorization, review, and safety arguments.
- Clean generated C is part of the compiler contract.

Because C is the IR, performance is added by later source-to-source passes over
that same C — correctness first, optimization afterwards. Typical passes:

- node / kernel fusion
- intermediate-memory reduction and buffer reuse
- vectorization onto SIMD / vector instruction sets
- target-specific memory-layout optimization
- offloading or DMA-streaming of large weights

A concrete example is the emmtrix Edge AI Compiler targeting RISC-V with the RVV
vector extension (project issue #723). A generated `Gemm -> Relu` model — a
scalar matmul loop nest plus a `Relu` — is transformed into vectorized C using
RVV intrinsics: the matmul reduction becomes vector fused-multiply-add
accumulation over the free dimension, and the `Relu` is fused into the vector
store (`vfmax` against zero). The loop nest is preserved (outer loop over rows,
inner reduction over the contraction dimension), and the vector length is just
the RVV register width, so the same code scales to realistic tensors. This only
works because the generated C is explicit and analyzable to begin with.

Relationship to other stacks:

- `onnx2c` was the most direct existing reference point for ONNX-to-C.
- Apache TVM and IREE are relevant ML compiler projects, but in our evaluation
  they did not provide the straightforward standalone ONNX-to-auditable-generic-C
  path we needed at the time.
- MLIR is the right conceptual comparison for staged lowering, but the practical
  trade-off is different: emmtrix uses C as the visible bridge into embedded and
  safety-critical toolchains.

## 10. Verification must preserve compile/verify parity

Important invariant:

Verification must not give the compiler extra information that normal
compilation does not receive.

Bad pattern:

- `verify` reads representative `input_*.pb` files
- those values or shapes make code generation succeed
- `compile` without those inputs would fail or generate different code

Project principle:

If a model requires representative inputs to resolve dynamic shapes, it should
fail clearly or require an explicit compiler option that is also available to
`compile`.

Why it matters:

- reproducibility
- deterministic code generation
- honest compiler contract
- meaningful test results

## 11. Operator importance is unknown

A process lesson rather than a semantics lesson: there is no signal telling a
backend author which operators matter.

- ONNX defines hundreds of operators as a flat set; nothing says how common,
  critical, or niche each one is.
- When implementing the operator set, the priority order was largely guesswork.
- Example: `ImageDecode` is purely a preprocessing / IO operator, not part of
  core inference, yet in the spec it looks no different in importance from
  essential math or neural-network operators.

Two constructive ideas:

- **Operator categories.** Tag operators by role (core math, neural-network
  layers, preprocessing / IO, control flow, quantization, classic ML, contrib)
  so backend authors can prioritize and scope by category.
- **An operator atlas.** Measure how often each operator actually appears in real
  models and publish a popularity-plus-coverage map — for example by indexing the
  roughly 40,000 ONNX models hosted on Hugging Face — so backends can prioritize
  the operators that occur in practice instead of guessing.
